        <title>Take Advantage of Fall and Sell Now</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUB8tez3Nx4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are five primary reasons why fall presents a great opportunity to sell your home quickly and for top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

Buying a Salt Lake City home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saltlakehomesearch.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the top five reasons the fall is actually a great time to sell your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;there’s less competition on the market.&lt;/strong&gt; During this time, a lot of other home sellers end up taking their homes off the market because their kids are busy with school, they have work obligations, or selling at the end of the year just doesn’t make sense for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;buyers are more motivated to buy.&lt;/strong&gt; They want to get into a home before the holidays arrive or before the end of the year. It’s possible that some have been searching since the summer, and they’re ready to become homeowners now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=DURING THIS TIME, A LOT OF OTHER HOME SELLERS END UP TAKING THEIR HOMES OFF THE MARKET.%20http://localhost:4000/take-advantage-of-fall-and-sell-now.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“DURING THIS TIME, A LOT OF OTHER HOME SELLERS END UP TAKING THEIR HOMES OFF THE MARKET.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, &lt;strong&gt;interest rates are still phenomenal.&lt;/strong&gt; Interest rates have adjusted, and sometimes when that happens, affordability becomes an issue. If you sell now, though, you can still lock a buyer into a low rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, &lt;strong&gt;homes show beautifully during the fall.&lt;/strong&gt; 92% of all buyers start their home search online, and 64% will pay more for a home that looks move-in ready. This is why a lot of folks who plan on putting their home on the market in December or January are taking photos of it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, &lt;strong&gt;it’s a lot easier to move now than when there’s snow on the ground.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to put your home on the market now or you have any questions about our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What You Need to Know About the Utah Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jQVmCXcDkZw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is happening in our Utah Market? Today I am going to look at it with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling your Salt Lake City home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justinudy.com/sell-your-home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buying a Salt Lake City home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saltlakehomesearch.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to give you a quick market update and tell you what you need to know about real estate in Utah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When comparing this quarter to last quarter, we are down 4.6% in home sales. In fact, the Board of Realtors said that, if we looked at listings, they are down 1.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we are seeing less homes on the market, our home values have increased dramatically. &lt;strong&gt;Since last year, the median home price in Salt Lake County has increased 7.8% from $327,000 to $352,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, different markets and areas are seeing different trends. However, this market has been fantastic with 10 years of growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, though, interest rates are &lt;strong&gt;increasing which affects affordability.&lt;/strong&gt; Recently, we had a buyer looking for a $440,000 home, but interest rates increased and reduced his affordability to $410,000. If you are selling a home, this changes the number of people that can buy your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we have less homes on the market, people become afraid of where they are going to go and buyers think that they can’t afford a home. Statistically, &lt;strong&gt;property values have increased by an average of 3.3%over the last 26 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you need to know is this: Interest rates are still great, but they are going up. It is affecting the affordability and is starting to squeeze the value and the affordability of homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are going to start seeing more and more townhome projects that come to your city planning meetings as well as smaller micro units. Also, according to economists at the University of Utah, we are seeing an increase in the number of multi-generational families that are living in the same habitation due to affordability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need anything such as a home value or a new home, now is a great time to look at different options. For sellers, it’s a good time to decide whether to sell or keep your home. Meanwhile, if you are looking at buying, you can look at the interest rates to see if it’s a good time to buy. I will say this: Never wait to buy real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Things You Can Do to Stage Your Home</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQpbDPzqqOo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I am sharing five decorating and staging tips to help maximize the value of your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling your Salt Lake City home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justinudy.com/sell-your-home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that 63% of buyers will actually pay more for a move-in ready home? Decorating and staging your home can improve its look and feel. To help you maximize the value of your property, I am going to share five home decorating and staging tips for you to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Make repairs to the home.&lt;/strong&gt; There are always a couple of repairs that need to be made. I love to say “pick five.” Sometimes there’s a baseboard missing, a light is missing, or a window is cracked. Find five things that need to be fixed, because fixing them will make your home look well-maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make sure your home is white-glove clean.&lt;/strong&gt; Your property should be spotless, both inside and out, and free of odors, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Look at the colors in your home.&lt;/strong&gt; People love neutral colors. Paint over the large red wall that was once a great look with a neutral color. It is going to make it feel bright and will help modernize your home. Fresh coats of paint can also help your home smell like it’s brand new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PROPERTY IS SPOTLESS BOTH INSIDE AND OUT AS WELL AS ELIMINATE ALL ODORS.%20http://localhost:4000/5-things-you-can-do-to-stage-your-home.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PROPERTY IS SPOTLESS BOTH INSIDE AND OUT AS WELL AS ELIMINATE ALL ODORS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Declutter your home.&lt;/strong&gt; After we have already done some work and added color, you need to declutter. You either want to toss it, give it, or prioritize it. If there are things that you haven’t touched in the last two years, you probably aren’t going to use them again and can instead get rid of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less is more, and the more belongings you have, the more cluttered your home will feel. When you do stage your home, think about the buyer. If your home is in an area where 90% of the buyers are going to have kids and potentially a baby, consider putting a cradle in a room. If it is going to be a business executive that might buy the home, make a room an office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Depersonalize the home.&lt;/strong&gt; Get rid of the religious photos and the collections. I also think that you should get rid of the personal photographs. The reason that this is important is that while you may worship Dale Earnhardt, not everybody does. You want to make it so that every consumer that goes in there can see what the home is and not what you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any additional questions about staging or would like a full list of staging recommendations, please feel free to contact us and we can get that to you. And, as always, if you are looking to buy or sell, reach out to us by phone or email. We would be happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Roadblocks on the Path to Your New Home</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_xmTumf3qS4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are purchasing a home, you want to have the smoothest transaction possible. There are five roadblocks that can prevent that smooth transaction from happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling your Salt Lake City home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justinudy.com/sell-your-home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buying a Salt Lake City home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saltlakehomesearch.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you purchase a home, there are five major things that can happen that can stop our sales. Today I am going to share those five roadblocks, so you can know what to avoid if you are buying a new home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Damage.&lt;/strong&gt; Damages can occur when the seller moves out, or from a contractor who has caused additional damage. To remedy this, you must always do a walk-through inspection. This can help you avoid discovering that things are missing, such as light bulbs, fixtures, or—even worse—appliances and cabinetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Due diligence.&lt;/strong&gt;  During the home inspection, ensure that all the repairs requested by the inspection are completed. Also, make sure that your insurance is active the day that you close—accidents happen, and you do not want to accidentally cause a fire. If your insurance is not set up at closing, it could cause a delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Survey.&lt;/strong&gt; Survey the land to find out where proper property lines are. This is something a lot of agents push to the side, but do not let them. Surveys are very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally purchased a duplex as an investment property and noticed something was strange about the lines. I had a survey completed and found that the neighbor had encroached 15 feet into the property that I was purchasing. I ended up giving him notice and putting up a fence. Now I have an entire parking spot for my tenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I COMPLETED A SURVEY OF A PROPERTY THAT I HAD PURCHASED, ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THE NEIGHBOR HAD ENCROACHED NEARLY 15 FEET INTO MY NEW PROPERTY.%20http://localhost:4000/5-roadblocks-on-path-to-your-new-home.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I COMPLETED A SURVEY OF A PROPERTY THAT I HAD PURCHASED, ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THE NEIGHBOR HAD ENCROACHED NEARLY 15 FEET INTO MY NEW PROPERTY.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Major purchases.&lt;/strong&gt; Refrain from big dollar purchases. Buying a car will affect your credit score, which may affect your mortgage rate and eventually affect your ability to even purchase the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Loan approval.&lt;/strong&gt; If a person unknowingly does something to impact their credit, they may be unable to secure a loan. Leaving a job or making an expensive purchase are just two of the ways someone may accidentally damage their score&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A loan company verifies your employment the day before closing. If you quit or lose your job the day before, you may end up unqualified for the loan because of lack of income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the money in the location it needs to be is also crucial. If you are receiving the money as a gift, it needs to be wired to your account before closing to verify that you have the sufficient funds. Very few people will let you have the keys to your new place if they are waiting for money to be approved for one reason or another—make sure that the funds are ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking to you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Questions That Will Determine Which Home Upgrades to Make</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-fMACSLSxs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To know which upgrades you should make to your home, there are five questions you need to ask yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling your Salt Lake City home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justinudy.com/sell-your-home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buying a Salt Lake City home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saltlakehomesearch.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the five questions you need to ask yourself to know which home upgrades will give you the biggest bang for your buck:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Does it make sense?&lt;/strong&gt; Does it make sense for you to invest money into your property? If your home is in an area you don’t want to live in anymore and you’re ready to move, it probably doesn’t make sense to invest any money into it other than what can be put toward getting it ready for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Does it make sense economically?&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have the cash on-hand to put into your property in order for the renovation to be a successful investment? Sometimes in this situation, homeowners take out a home equity line of credit at a typically low interest rate. If you do something like this, the goal is to pay off debt immediately. I don’t love second mortgages, so my advice is to not use one unless you don’t have the cash on-hand, you know you’ll be in the house long-term, and you know you’ll see a return on your investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=ASKING THESE QUESTIONS CAN HELP YOU BUILD WEALTH THROUGH REAL ESTATE.%20http://localhost:4000/5-questions-that-will-determine-which.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“ASKING THESE QUESTIONS CAN HELP YOU BUILD WEALTH THROUGH REAL ESTATE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Will you see a return on your investment (ROI)?&lt;/strong&gt; To know if a renovation makes sense, you need to understand the market you’re in and the type of property you have. Do you really need marble floors installed into your $300,000 home or would hardwood or laminate floors make more sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Will your upgrade(s) be sellable?&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes we want to make an amazing upgrade, but it just doesn’t make sense to do so. I’ve seen people make adjustments to their home where their space was so unique that it made it difficult for anyone else to move into that space&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Will your upgrade(s) make sense long-term?&lt;/strong&gt; Anytime you put money into a property, it has to make sense in terms of the general market. You might want to take out three bedrooms and two bathrooms on your main level and turn them into one master bedroom and one master bathroom, but your neighborhood might not be conducive to those upgrades. That neighborhood, for instance, might be in a price point more appropriate for first-time homebuyers or those looking for a move-up property. You don’t want to make upgrades to your home that will hurt its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the goals I want to help you with is to build wealth through real estate, and asking these kinds of questions can accomplish this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Affordability Is Affected by Increased Prices</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TXgA7Jcxgsg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do our current increased prices mean to you? If you are an owner, it means that you have more money without even doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to talk to you about how the increase in pricing, interest rates, and affordability can affect you and your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people have been asking about what the market is going to do and where are we going. Here are the facts. The market is growing. The prices are rising. And, interest rates are going up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors create an issue where someone that could previously afford a home for $1500/mo. is now looking at paying $1,700 to $1,800 per month. This is not just because the rates went up but also because the value of the home increased. People are running into the issue of how it affects them and their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to last year, we are finding a couple of differences. One is that &lt;strong&gt;we have even fewer homes on the market, but we have more sales occurring in the market.&lt;/strong&gt; This creates a supply and demand issue which pushes up prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=INCREASED PRICES AFFECT YOUR HOME PERSONALLY BECAUSE YOUR HOME IS NOW GROWING IN EQUITY.%20http://localhost:4000/how-affordability-is-affected-by.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“INCREASED PRICES AFFECT YOUR HOME PERSONALLY BECAUSE YOUR HOME IS NOW GROWING IN EQUITY.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This affects your home personally because your home is now growing in equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that new equity, you can take it and sell your home, and buy a larger home. Also, if you are planning on upsizing, you have the amount you have paid off for your current mortgage which you can transfer to a new property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you can use that new equity to get a home equity line of credit for updates. If you have the cash, I do suggest you use it. However, using this will allow you to make your home a better place for you and your family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can keep the equity where it is and continue to own this same property. You can either continue to live there yourself, or you could also turn it into an investment property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you can make it an investment property with a higher lease than your mortgage payment, this will create an amazing source of income.&lt;/strong&gt; It also creates a part of a portfolio for future growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, just consider that when there are changes in the market and issues with affordability, it unfortunately creates a situation where some people who want to buy are pushed out of the market. They instead continue to rent. While the real estate market does go up and down over time, rents will continue to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you can consider this as an opportunity to get in our growing market. In the event that it does slow, you wouldn’t have an issue like you would with renting because you will already be locked in with a great rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any further questions or would like to speak to me about buying or selling, please feel free to contact me by phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Prepare for Your Next Real Estate Investment</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ugygnkZb-lU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about investing in real estate in order to build wealth, you’re not alone. Here are some tips that will get you started off on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling your Salt Lake City home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justinudy.com/sell-your-home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it take to buy a home? If you are someone who is looking to buy a new home or helping someone else through the process, there are some things that you should know. Today I have a quick list of things that you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I was ever a real estate agent, I was buying and selling investment properties. This is something I’ve always enjoyed and something you should think about. Whether you’re thinking about buying your first property or your fifth, here are a few helpful tips for success with investment properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Always make sure your finances are in order.&lt;/strong&gt; We are finding fantastic properties, but when one buyer’s finances fall through there are always three or four back-up offers from eager buyers waiting to pounce. The seller won’t hesitate to move to the next in line if you’re not prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Be proactive about having everyone and everything ready to go.&lt;/strong&gt; If we’re dealing with a development, that means we need engineers, geotech, soil testing, surveyors, and architects. We want to make sure that we have the proper forms, rent rates, and every other detail ready to go. We have all of these resources ready for you so that you can find success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE IS A FANTASTIC WAY TO BUILD WEALTH.%20http://localhost:4000/how-to-prepare-for-your-next-real.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE IS A FANTASTIC WAY TO BUILD WEALTH.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Find the project.&lt;/strong&gt; The market is great and I think it will go up for at least the next 18 months. There’s going to be an affordability issue at some point, and then you’ll see a leveling off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to what investors should be looking for in a property, &lt;strong&gt;there are three must-haves:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The property must have equity already.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an opportunity to maximize its best use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a potential for cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have these three things, you’re facing an uphill battle. For example, &lt;strong&gt;if you don’t have a property that’s cash-flow positive, that’s when people go bankrupt and lose everything.&lt;/strong&gt; Back during the mortgage crisis, my rentals went down significantly in value, but the rents remained the same. I was able to use that money to sustain my business during those tough times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many opportunities involved with investing in real estate. If you have any questions or you want to learn more, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Steps in the Home Buying Process</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1dpJNR-592Y?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know what it takes to buy a home? Today I have five tips to share about the home buying process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling your Salt Lake City home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justinudy.com/sell-your-home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it take to buy a home? If you are someone who is looking to buy a new home or helping someone else through the process, there are some things that you should know. Today I have a quick list of things that you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You have got to talk to somebody that is an expert advisor.&lt;/strong&gt; You need someone that can help you navigate through the process. They must know what to look for—not only the problems of the sticks and bricks, but of the values of that property short term and long term. Get the right person—somebody that understands the market and can take you through everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Shop for the perfect property.&lt;/strong&gt; It may be easy to look online, but it’s hard to narrow down your options. Sometimes it involves taking your 100 favorite properties and narrowing it down to your top ten before picking out one. At the end of the day, set a parameter. Then we can help you look for a home and make an offer. We evaluate not only the values of the market but also what we’re seeing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=SET A PARAMETER, THEN WE CAN HELP YOU LOOK FOR A HOME.%20http://localhost:4000/5-steps-in-home-buying-process.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“SET A PARAMETER, THEN WE CAN HELP YOU LOOK FOR A HOME.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. You will want to research it.&lt;/strong&gt; You have to know, based on the offer and what has been established, is that property worth it? We bring in all of our resources, including home inspectors, engineers, and electricians, with specialized expertise that can help us check it out and get more information about that property. Every property is completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Make sure that you are keeping your finances safe.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t buy dumb things or lose/quit your job. Keep everything in order. Make sure that everything is perfect with finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Next, we are going through closing.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve set everything up. We have researched the property, found the perfect home, and our finances are ready. Once the appraisal is back and the due diligence is complete, we are going to close the property and get the keys. You own it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this process or want to know more about why you should buy now, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I would be happy to speak with you any time by phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, let’s take a look at the list of top projects:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attic insulation&lt;/li&gt;
