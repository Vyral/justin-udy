We’ve been getting a lot of questions lately about curb appeal, so we’re going to discuss its importance to home sellers today. **Four things create value in a home: curb appeal, kitchen, bathrooms, and amenities.**&nbsp;

The reason curb appeal is on this list isn’t as much about how much is put into the property, but the perceived value that can be created through it. We want to use curb appeal to create something enticing, inviting, and appealing. **Here are three things to consider when it comes to curb appeal:**

**1\. 95% of our buyers look online first.** Curb appeal might have been less important when it was all about what you saw in person or driving by. With the world of online listings, great curb appeal not only appeals to buyers, but it attracts them to want to see the home in person. The first picture buyers see of a house gives it this additional traction on the market.

**2\. 64% of buyers will pay more for a move-in ready home.** When a home looks ready on the outside, they’ll expect that it’s ready on the inside too. If it is, you’re going to net a higher sale price.

**3\. Without curb appeal, you won’t have many interested buyers.** The way your home looks online should be great, but it should be just as great in person.&nbsp;

Statistically, a buyer will decide within the first 15 seconds if they want to buy your home or not. Our goal is to make the property look, feel, and do something amazing to the buyer so they will make that initial decision to buy.

**I recently decided to invest in the curb appeal in one of my properties.** I did this because I know when I invest in the curb appeal, I increase the property's value, attract better tenants to the home, and more. We were able to get so much more from this property as a result.

If you have any questions about curb appeal or want to know what you can do to increase your own home’s appeal, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
