Are you ready for our client appreciation event? It’s here, and you’re invited. This is **our annual harvest fest here at Wheeler Farm** at 6351 South, 900 East. Please put it on your calendar for November 12 between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. We’re doing our pumpkin pie giveaway, and you’ll be able to take it home with you and eat it or freeze it for Thanksgiving.

We’ll be giving away one pie per family. Make sure you register because we want to know how many pies we need in order to ensure it's available for you to pick up. **We’ll also be catering lunch through Chick-Fil-A**—so come hungry.

Bring your family and kids. We want to make sure we see you\! There will be games available, like cornhole, and we’ll have a face painter and pin the tail on the turkey. There will be a coloring contest with prizes, along with additional giveaways.

**Our charity of choice is Toys for Tots**. So if you have an unopened gift, please bring it with you. We would love to take that gift and deliver it to Toys for Tots on your behalf.

Regarding the event, there's plenty of parking, but be sure to register at [justinudyevents.com](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv6kvZ3ByQlgID5xsiuEy-G2LCBvc46M4nv6S9Hfdzbi1CxQ/viewform). If you have questions, just reach out to us at our direct phone number (801) 449-3058. We’re looking forward to seeing you\!
