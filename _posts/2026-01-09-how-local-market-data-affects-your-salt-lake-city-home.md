Imagine two neighborhoods just five minutes apart. In one, homes sit on the market for months. In the other, homes are selling almost as soon as they’re listed. Which neighborhood reflects the real market? The answer isn’t found in national headlines; it’s found right around your property. That’s why I always focus on the neighborhood first.

Here’s what I pay attention to in your neighborhood and the local data that affects your home.

**Local details that actually matter.** What really affects your home is your price point, the homes that are active, the ones under contract, days on market, and what has sold recently. Not sales from months ago, but homes that sold in the last few weeks. That recent data shows what buyers are doing right now.

By looking at hyperlocal data, I can see where buyers are competing and where they’re pulling back. That’s how we price homes competitively and intentionally, and how we keep homes from sitting on the market. Pricing and strategy should never be a guess. It should always be based on what’s actually happening in your area.

**Shifting the question to your situation.** When clients understand this, they stop asking, “*Is now a good time?*” and start asking, *“What would you do in my situation, where I live?”* That’s when decisions become informed instead of stressful.

**Let’s create a location-specific game plan for your property.** Whether you’re selling, looking at an investment, or just exploring options, my job is to create a game plan for your specific property and location. The macro market can look very different from the micro market, and that difference matters.

With the right data and experience, homes can sell for more money and spend less time on the market because they’re positioned the right way with a plan built for that home and that neighborhood.
