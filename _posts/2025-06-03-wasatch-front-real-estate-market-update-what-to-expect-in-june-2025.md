The real estate landscape across the Wasatch Front is going through some noticeable shifts. Market trends are beginning to reflect a combination of rising inventory, steady buyer activity, and evolving pricing strategies. Here's everything you need to know:<br><br>**Inventory is up, but still remains low.** As of June 2025, inventory has increased by 50% compared to this time last year, and the number of sold listings has decreased by 1%. While this shift may seem surprising, it is important to note that the overall inventory is still among the lowest seen in recent years.

{% include pullquote.html %}<br><br>**The gap between buyers and sellers**. This change means there are more options available on the market, which allows buyers to view and consider more properties. However, a clear gap remains between buyer expectations and seller pricing. Properties that are successfully selling tend to offer incentives. In most cases, these are not major price reductions but rather concessions. Sellers are ensuring their properties are in good condition, offering terms that provide flexibility, such as longer occupancy periods, or making agreements that benefit both parties.

**Market activity is still strong**. Despite the statistics, market activity remains strong. It is important to remember that the market in which a property is sold is also the market in which the next purchase will take place. In a recent personal experience, I listed a property I had purchased and renovated. Initially, I expected to price it higher, but after assessing current trends, I made a minor adjustment. Although the buyers requested some concessions, which I granted, the result was a profitable sale. Both sides were satisfied, and I am now in a position to reinvest the proceeds into another property.

**What's next with interest rates?** Looking ahead, interest rates are currently hovering around 7 percent. However, major financial institutions and research-based organizations are projecting a possible decrease by the end of the year. Forecasts suggest rates may fall to between 6.2 and 6.7 percent. These projections depend heavily on changes in the broader economy. If interest rates do decline, significant shifts in the market are likely to follow. Lower rates generally make homeownership more accessible and could lead to increased demand.

For those considering selling, success comes from accurate pricing and strong property presentation. Homes that are properly priced and well-prepared for the market are the ones that are selling. Meanwhile, properties that are overpriced or in poor condition are not attracting buyers and remain unsold.<br><br>Whether your goal is to buy, sell, or invest, it is important to understand the current trends.
