With the holiday season in full swing, I want to invite you and your family to participate in our latest client event: The 12 Days of Christmas. **This event will run from December 14 through Christmas Day.** Each day, we’ll give away a fabulous gift at random to anyone who registers. We have a ton of great items available including a YETI cooler, Traeger grill, big-screen TV, etc.&nbsp;

During this time, everyone on our team will also make a donation to a charity of their choice. This is a fun way for us to connect with you and celebrate the holiday season. These events are also very special to me because when I was a solo agent, I always wanted to do something like this, and now I can. I love this time of year, and it should be tons of fun\!

**To find out more about this event, including how to register, visit [justinudyevents.com](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetLDGR-tGyOnIdoXV5k3gwEt1_lunO3nWpuFiJrpfbmi9NCQ/viewform){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.** If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
