If you’re thinking about selling your home this year, you’ve probably checked its value using tools like Zillow or Redfin. These apps promise quick estimates based on data and algorithms, and they’re getting better every year. But here’s the big question: **can you** ***really*** **trust AI to price your most valuable asset accurately?**

Before you list your home with an AI price estimate, you need to hear this:

I recently worked with a client just outside of town who was ready to sell their four-bedroom home in a competitive market and decided to use an AI tool for a pricing estimate. AI pulled data from recent sales nearby, adjusted for square footage, and looked at market trends. It estimated their home’s value at $620,000.

However, it missed some key features: a $70,000 kitchen renovation with high-end appliances, a full smart-home upgrade, and a prime location on a quiet cul-de-sac with greenbelt views. None of these factors was reflected in the AI estimate.

After I walked through the property and analyzed local buyer demand, we listed the home at $685,000 and received multiple offers within days. **That’s a $65,000 difference between the AI estimate and the actual market value.**

So, let’s break down what these tools do well, where they fall short, and how to ensure your pricing strategy helps you avoid losing out on thousands.

**What AI does well in home valuation.** AI tools have come a long way by 2025. They pull in tons of [data from public records, MLS sales, and even tax info](https://www.riskwire.com/how-ai-is-transforming-property-valuation/) to give you a quick estimate of your home’s value.

If you’re in a neighborhood with cookie-cutter houses, like a suburban subdivision where every home’s got a similar vibe, these tools can be pretty spot-on. They’re awesome for getting a ballpark figure without picking up the phone to call an agent. Plus, they’re always learning, tweaking their numbers based on stuff like interest rates and market trends. It’s fast, it’s easy, and it’s a solid starting point.

**Where AI misses the mark.** Despite their strengths, AI tools have notable blind spots. They can’t physically tour your home to assess unique upgrades, like a $40,000 basement turned home theater or breathtaking mountain views.

It also struggles in markets with diverse or limited sales data, like older neighborhoods, custom builds, or rural spots. In fast-changing markets, [AI often lags, relying on past sales](https://www.housematch.com/blog/2024/2/9/zestimate-vs-cma-why-the-cma-wins-every-time) rather than current buyer behavior. A 2025 survey of real estate pros found that [87% think AI undervalues homes](https://bridgingandcommercial.co.uk/article/21466/90-of-estate-agents-believe-avms-undervalue-properties-says-alto) with unique features or upgrades, which could mean fewer buyers or lowball offers for you.

**AI valuations can influence buyer expectations.** AI-driven estimates don’t just affect sellers; they affect homebuyers, too. If Zillow or Redfin says your home’s value is less than your asking price, buyers may assume your home is overpriced, even if your price is spot-on. This kind of mismatch can lead to fewer showings, lower offers, or unnecessary negotiations.

Setting clear expectations through strategic pricing and marketing is essential to counteract these effects and keep your sales on track.

**Why local real estate agents still rule.** AI’s only as good as the data it has, and that data isn’t always up to speed. A new development down the road or a big community project boosting your neighborhood’s appeal? AI might not know about it yet, but a local agent does. We’re out there seeing what’s selling, what’s sitting, and what buyers are buzzing about at open houses. That kind of real-time, boots-on-the-ground insight gives human expertise an edge that no algorithm can match.

**What’s the best strategy to get your home’s true value?** Simply put, just use both AI *and* ask for help from a local expert. Having a local real estate agent help you with your pricing will be one of your best decisions if you want to get more for your home. AI is a great starting point, but it shouldn’t be your only pricing tool. Top agents combine data-driven tools with real-time feedback and local knowledge.

We use AI for broad trends and human experience for the details that actually drive offers. Remember: Getting the price right isn’t just about numbers, it’s about understanding what makes your home stand out today.
