How do you get the home you want in our ultra-competitive Salt Lake City market? Here are the nine tips we impart to our buyer clients that help them secure the best homes at the lowest interest rates:&nbsp;

**1\. Get a pre-approval letter.** This way, you can start your home search with money already in your pocket.&nbsp;

**2\. Have your finances in order.** This means your earnest money should be ready.&nbsp;

**3\. Have a personal letter ready to send to the seller.** This letter explains to them who you are outside of just a potential buyer.

**4\. Rely on your agent.** They know the home values, transaction deadlines, and how to make your offer competitive. They’ll also have the necessary contractors and vendors lined up.&nbsp;

**5\. Don’t change your employment status.** Try to stay at your current job.&nbsp;

**6\. Don’t make any large purchases.** On a related note, don’t apply for credit in a bunch of different places. This changes the amount of debt you have, which can cause lending issues.

**7\. Don’t make large deposits into your account.** This only creates a paper trail that you’ll have to explain to your lender.&nbsp;

**8\. Don’t cosign on anything.** Additionally, don’t spend any of the money you’ve set aside for closing.&nbsp;

**9\. Don’t delay providing information to your lender.** They rely on this information to serve you\!
