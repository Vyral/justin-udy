Selling your home requires more than just pricing it correctly. The condition and showability of your property are just as crucial to attract potential buyers. No matter how much money you spend on marketing, if people can't physically visit and see your property, all your efforts will be in vain. This is particularly significant in today's market, where buyers have plenty of options to choose from.

**Marketing 101 dictates the product must be able to be evaluated by the consumer.** In real estate, this means the property must be evaluated and inspected properly by buyers to facilitate a sale. The longer a property sits unsold and cannot be shown, the more it devalues in the eyes of a buyer.

For example, as we head out of winter and snow is still on the ground, people do not want to get their shoes wet or get in the snow. Therefore, it is crucial to clear out the walkway to increase your chances of attracting potential buyers. This won’t be done on 90% of the vacant properties, and those properties will not be shown.

When there's a high inventory in the market, you must improve that condition and showability so people will look at the home. Properties that are inaccessible or not being shown will be pushed aside, whereas those that are ready and showable will receive offers. **If you can't get the work done, ensure you have an agent helping you and assisting you.**
