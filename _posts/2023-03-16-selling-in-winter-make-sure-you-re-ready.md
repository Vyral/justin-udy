When discussing selling in the wintertime, we have to talk about the price we set on the property. What are the condition and showability? What is the marketing that we do? However, no matter how much money you spend on marketing, if people can't get into the property and see it, they won’t set foot on your property.

People don't want to get their shoes wet. They don't want to get in the snow. **You need to make sure you clear it out.** By simply clearing out the walkway so people can walk in, you increase your chances of being shown and sold. This won’t be done on 90% of the vacant properties, and those properties will not be shown.

When there's a high inventory in the market, you have to improve that condition and showability so that people will look at the home. The people who do this get offers because the other houses are inaccessible, they're not being shown, and people put them to the side. Make sure your property is ready, and the condition and showability are there. That is a part of the marketing. **If you can't get the work done, ensure you have an agent helping you and assisting you.**
