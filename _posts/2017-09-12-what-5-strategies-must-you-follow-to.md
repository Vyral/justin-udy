At the end of June, U.S. News & World Report named the greater Salt Lake area as one of the 10 best places in the nation to live in terms of home affordability, job opportunities, and the cost of living. Because we’re in a location where values continue to grow, there are five strategies you as a buyer need to follow to win in this market.

 For most people, the biggest fear they have when moving on to their next home is being able to find that home in the first place. To be prepared and to combat any uncertainty, you must first **get pre-approved.** This will give you the ability to purchase the home you want after you sell your current home.

 Second, you need to **have your agent do a market analysis** for you so you’re correctly evaluating the homes on the market and whether they fit your pre-approved budget.

Next, you need to prep your current home for the market. The home preparation method we use for our buyers, for instance, includes our 75-point photography checklist, home staging, and our pre-inspection checklist. All this is done to make sure your home is ready to go, ready to show, and ready to sell.

After that, **be knowledgeable about the market** so you know how to deal with multiple offer situations. We educate all of our buyers about this subject so their offers are the ones getting accepted.

Lastly, be ready to move quickly. In our market, if you see a home you like, there are probably three or four others who like it as well. If you adhere to the four previous points mentioned above, you should be able to get the home you want.

If you have any other questions about what you need to do in order to move into your next home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.
