**Our annual Harvest Fest is coming up, and you’re invited!** On November 11, 2023, we will be having our free client event from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Have fun with the different activities that we prepared, and also participate in giving the gift of happiness this season by donating to Toys for Tots. If you would like to join this cause, please bring an unopened toy that you and your family would like to donate.

We're also excited to announce that Chick-fil-A will be catering the event, and we have a fun lineup of activities planned for you, including a coloring contest and face painting. For those who prefer something other than Chick-fil-A, we'll also have a hot chocolate bar. Additionally, there will be games and prizes for everyone to enjoy, and each family will receive a pumpkin pie to take home for Thanksgiving.
