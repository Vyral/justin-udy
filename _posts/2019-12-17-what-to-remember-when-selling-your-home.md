My team and I have sold over 1,000 homes in the Salt Lake City area, and I can tell you that there are three components to a successful home sale:

1. **Price**
2. **Presentation**
3. **Perception**

Right now, there are more agents in our market than we’ve ever seen—even more than we had in 2007—and I think this is fantastic. I love this business. It creates opportunities for people, and I love that there are more people out there who can provide more value for our clients. What I don’t like is when new agents jump into the business and don’t do the things you need to do to serve their clients at the highest level.&nbsp;

How do these components determine a successful home sale? If you price a home too high, you help the competition sell their homes. If you price it too low, you leave money on the table. Presenting a home means staging, cleaning, and decluttering it so that we’re preparing it in a different way than the competition.&nbsp;

**When it’s time to present the home to the market, we spend money on the type of marketing that attracts hundreds of buyers each month,** which is where perception comes into play. Whether that means marketing on social media or cold calling, we make sure we actively and aggressively pursue the market to bring in both local and out-of-state buyers.&nbsp;

By preparing the home with the help of our clients, making sure the pricing is in line, and getting as many buyers walking through the home as possible, we can generate a whole list of people to follow up with and attract multiple offers.&nbsp;

So when listing your home, think about price, presentation, and perception.

If you have any more questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
