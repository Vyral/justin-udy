Here’s a quick run-through of why there are many differences in pricing between modern homes and traditional homes:

**1\. Design.** Modern houses are typically a bit more innovative in their design and have more linear concepts than traditional homes.

**2\. Materials.** Often, modern materials are sleek and contemporary, so the cost per square foot is different from materials used in the past.&nbsp;

**3\. Demand.** Modern houses are attracting more people right now, and they’re willing to pay more in the current market.&nbsp;
