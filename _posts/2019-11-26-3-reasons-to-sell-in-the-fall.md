Why should you sell in the fall versus the spring? When thinking of selling their home, people this time of year are considering whether they should wait to sell their home until the spring or put it on the market now. Here are some elements to think about:

**1\. Low interest rates.** The market right now has the lowest interest rates we’ve ever seen. Take advantage of them while you can\! As interest rates have fallen it’s made homes more affordable. This has created more opportunity.&nbsp;

**2\. Less competition.** The lack of inventory means less competition. People are still looking for homes after summer is over but many homeowners take their houses off the market in early autumn. Homebuyers will embrace a home they find now, rather than waiting until the spring.&nbsp;

**3\. Everyone’s waiting.** This is the worst issue we run into. If you wait for the spring, expect to list your home along with everyone else\! We have a flood of inventory when spring comes, not only existing homes but new construction as well. If you aren’t priced correctly, you’re actually helping the competition sell\!&nbsp;

There are pros and cons to selling in both the spring and fall. If you’re considering selling a home, I’ll be glad to run the numbers for you. The market’s incredible right now.
