Today I’m especially excited to share a market forecast for 2021 because all indicators point to a record-breaking year for home sales. The market increased by a little more than 11% last year, but experts are anticipating appreciation of 6% to 8% this year—not double-digit growth, but certainly still phenomenal, stable growth. Also, Salt Lake City was among the top 10 cities for job growth last year, making us one of the best secondary local markets in the nation. What’s a “secondary” market, though? Also, should you be worried about a bubble bursting soon?
