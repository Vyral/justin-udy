Why should you be paying attention to the terms of the market? Actually, there are a couple of reasons.

Why should you be paying attention to the terms of the market? Actually, there are a couple of reasons.

Whether you’re buying an investment property, you’re buying a second property, or are moving into a single-family home, the terms of the market are just as valuable as the price.

Let’s take the example of comparing a $1 million home at a 1% interest rate to a $100,000 home with a 10% interest rate. These payments would end up being very similar, but the real issue is the terms of the interest rate.

There are a few quick statistics I’d like you to think about. **The average rental rate in the market is constantly rising.** And with all of the people currently moving into our area, this is expected to continue.

My point is that: interest rates in the market allow us to purchase and own at a better price. This means you can typically own a home for less money than it would take to rent one.

These interest rates will not last. And when they do rise, **you won’t be able to match the kind of terms we’re seeing today.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
