When the market shifts, what can you do to make sure your home is the one that sells and not the one that sits? Recently, I flipped a home for 20% profit after holding it for only three weeks. How did I do that in a changing market like ours? I’m not a big believer in flipping, but with the five Cs of real estate, you can sell any property for a profit:

**1\. Clutter.** Eliminate any and all junk. Show off your beautiful property. If buyers see a home full of clutter, they’ll just move on to a different, cleaner place.&nbsp;

**2\. Cleanliness.** Your property should be white-glove clean if possible. We had professionals come to the home and deep clean so that it even smelled nice.

**3\. Color.** Neutral colors are always best. Exotic colors might appeal to some buyers, but you should cast the widest net possible.&nbsp;

**4\. Curb appeal.** First impressions are everything in real estate. How your house looks from the street has a huge impact on buyers’ perceptions.&nbsp;

**5\. Creativity.** To deal with the issues people face in this market, you need to get creative. Interest rates are a big problem for some buyers, so I worked with ours to help them secure proper financing and lower their costs.&nbsp;
