What does it take to buy a home? If you are someone who is looking to buy a new home or helping someone else through the process, there are some things that you should know. Today I have a quick list of things that you need to know:

**1. You have got to talk to somebody that is an expert advisor.** You need someone that can help you navigate through the process. They must know what to look for—not only the problems of the sticks and bricks, but of the values of that property short term and long term. Get the right person—somebody that understands the market and can take you through everything.

**2. Shop for the perfect property.** It may be easy to look online, but it’s hard to narrow down your options. Sometimes it involves taking your 100 favorite properties and narrowing it down to your top ten before picking out one. At the end of the day, set a parameter. Then we can help you look for a home and make an offer. We evaluate not only the values of the market but also what we're seeing today.

**3. You will want to research it.** You have to know, based on the offer and what has been established, is that property worth it? We bring in all of our resources, including home inspectors, engineers, and electricians, with specialized expertise that can help us check it out and get more information about that property. Every property is completely different.

**4. Make sure that you are keeping your finances safe.** Don’t buy dumb things or lose/quit your job. Keep everything in order. Make sure that everything is perfect with finances.

**5. Next, we are going through closing.** We've set everything up. We have researched the property, found the perfect home, and our finances are ready. Once the appraisal is back and the due diligence is complete, we are going to close the property and get the keys. You own it.

If you have any questions about this process or want to know more about why you should buy now, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I would be happy to speak with you any time by phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
