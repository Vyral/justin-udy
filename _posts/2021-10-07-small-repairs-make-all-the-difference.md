Are you looking to sell your home? **Don’t sweat the big renovations**; instead, I want to tell you why small repairs make all the difference when selling your home.&nbsp;

To illustrate my point, I purchased a property a while back that was up by Mill Creek, and it was in bad shape. Even though it had a ton of problems, I decided not to do all the repairs. Instead, I replaced the furnace, painted it, and replaced the broken windows. These may not sound like tiny repairs, but the property probably needed $80,000 worth of repairs while we kept it to $10,000.&nbsp;

When we put the property on the market, I only had to make three phone calls before I was able to sell the property for a great price. I fixed the glaring issues and presented the buyer with a blank canvas so they could do whatever they wanted. I have a long history of selling homes, and I can confidently say that something like painting your home or putting in new carpet will go a long way. Let me go over a few reasons why:

1. **Small repairs increase perceived value.** Have you ever gone into a car dealership or model home and noticed how nice everything is? It’s because they maintain their inventory. Small repairs give your home the same feeling.
2. **Small repairs help with the inspection.** Even a highly motivated buyer will be turned off by a huge list of repairs. If you fix the small stuff yourself, the inspector won’t find as many issues, and buyers will be more likely to close on the home.&nbsp;
3. **Small repairs have a great return on investment.** I can give you example after example of $1,000 worth of repairs bringing in an extra $10,000. It’s because you aren’t just adding value to your home; you’re marketing it better. People are busy, and they don’t want to waste their time making tiny repairs all over their new home. Putting a move-in ready property on the market gives you a huge leg up over the competition.&nbsp;
