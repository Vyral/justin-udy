Selling a home comes with legal responsibilities, including the obligation to disclose material facts about the property. Regardless of whether the seller has lived in the home, any known defects or issues that could affect the property’s value or use must be disclosed. This ensures transparency and protects both the seller and potential buyers. If you’re unsure what needs to be disclosed, here are three key things every seller must reveal:

<br>**1\. Material defects.** Sellers must inform buyers about any material defects in the property that could impact its value. These are issues that may not be easily detected during a standard inspection. Even if you’ve repaired these problems, it’s essential to disclose them. Buyers need a full picture of the property’s history so they can make informed decisions. Transparency builds trust with buyers and helps prevent disputes later on.

This includes anything from mold and asbestos to water damage or chemical contamination. Providing this context allows buyers to make an informed decision and shows that you’re committed to transparency, which can set the tone for a positive and cooperative transaction.

**3\. Repairs and modifications**. Any repairs or modifications made to the property should be disclosed along with supporting documentation. Providing receipts, warranties, and repair records can give buyers confidence that the work was done professionally. Clear documentation helps eliminate doubts and can even make the home more appealing.

**The risk of failing to disclose.** Some sellers may hesitate to disclose defects out of fear that it will reduce their home’s value. However, withholding information can lead to serious legal consequences, including accusations of fraud. If a seller fails to disclose known defects, they may be held liable for damages after the sale. Full transparency protects sellers from legal trouble and builds buyer confidence.<br><br>Thorough and accurate disclosures lead to more successful home sales.
