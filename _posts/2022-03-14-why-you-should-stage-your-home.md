Have you ever wondered if you should stage your home before you sell? Most real estate experts will tell you that it’s a great idea, but why? Today I want to explain why staging works and how you can use it to get more out of your home sale.&nbsp;

I’m coming to you today from a property that I own, and when I decided I wanted to sell, I knew that some staging was necessary. A lot of people think staging is a big elaborate thing, and while it can be that, you can also opt for smaller changes. For minor staging, the cost will probably run you around $500, but the bigger projects can be thousands of dollars. Given the cost, why is staging worth it?&nbsp;

First, **your house will show better online, in photos, and in person.** The feeling of a home that’s been staged is completely different from one that hasn’t. Instead of viewing your property as a series of doors and rooms, buyers will see it as a home they could live in.&nbsp;

Second, **staging accents the value and purpose of your property.** Take the property I’m standing in, for example. I decided to go with a modern design, but things felt forced. After staging, the space feels natural, like it was always supposed to look this way.&nbsp;

Third, and probably most important, **staging helps your home sell faster and for more money.** Think of it this way: If you have 20 people who walk into your property, but it feels empty and directionless, it’s very easy for most of those people to move on to the next house. However, a staged home provides a full experience. Now, most of those 20 people will want to make an offer on your property. The competition drives up the price, and you more than make back your investment.&nbsp;

Hopefully, you now understand why staging is worth the cost. If you have questions about staging, please call or email my team. We’d love to help you get more out of your home sale.
