As exciting as moving into a new home may be, it can also be very daunting. Many people feel uneasy during their first few weeks in their new home. This is common. But what happens when feeling uneasy transitions into feeling unsafe?

Security is of the utmost importance for homeowners. Thankfully, so long as you have taken the proper precautions, the likelihood of something happening to you or your home is slim.

**There are three elements criminals leverage when attempting a break-in: speed, silence, and low visibility.**

Criminals tend to target properties where they will be able to move quickly and silently as they enter and exit your home. They also look for homes that offer plenty of places to hide.

**By eliminating these factors within your own home, you can also vastly reduce the potential that you’ll fall victim to a crime.**

There are a couple of ways you can do this.

First, make sure to install plenty of outdoor lighting and, if possible, a security system—preferably one with a camera. Don’t make a criminal’s “job” easy. Instead, **keep your property well maintained and well lit.**

You should also be very mindful of letting strangers into your property. Run background checks on any vendors or contractors you plan to invite in, and avoid letting suspicious salespeople step inside.

Another way to protect yourself is by getting a guard dog. Your four-legged friend doesn’t have to be fearsome—simply having an animal with heightened hearing living in your home can be enough.

And speaking of heightened awareness, it’s always a good idea to get to know your neighbors. This way you can keep an eye out for each other. There’s strength in numbers, so the more eyes and ears you have on your home, the better.

Of course, **you shouldn’t trust someone simply because they live next door.** &nbsp;

Finally, realize that theft doesn’t always mean a burglar physically entering your home. Identity theft is also an issue. Always shred important documents before throwing them in the trash. It’s better to be safe than sorry.
