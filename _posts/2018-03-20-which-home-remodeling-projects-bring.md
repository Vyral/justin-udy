Which remodel projects will bring the highest returns when you list your home? Let’s take a look at the results of a recent study.

Remodeling Magazine recently came out with a list of the top projects with the highest return on investment.  

I’m going to share this list with you today but before I do, there’s something I want you to keep in mind: Things in our market might be a little different than what works well on a national level. Overall, this list has a lot of great points that can help you earn more money for your home.

Before you make any major remodels, we’d be happy to provide you with guidance as to which projects will work best for your home.

**Finally, let’s take a look at the list of top projects:**

2. A new front door
3. Stone veneer
4. A new garage door
5. Kitchen updates
6. New siding
7. New windows
