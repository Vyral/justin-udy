In these crazy times, the real estate market has changed. Today Iâ€™ll discuss some of these changes and a few advantages that home shoppers have. First of all, the way that sellers are showing and marketing homes has had to adapt to social distancing measures. For obvious reasons, in-person open houses are off the menu, but virtual open houses allow for sellers to show properties and buyers to see them, all from the safety of their own homes. One advantage homebuyers can enjoy in our market is the severely reduced competition from other buyers.

If you have questions about our market or are thinking of buying a home soon, don't hesitate to call or email me. I'm here to help.
