Did you know that between 2010 and 2017, Salt Lake City was ranked the No. 1 city in the nation in terms of job growth? It’s true, and this has had an incredible impact on our real estate market.&nbsp;

**50% of buyers who have relocated to our city have done so because of the job market,** which just goes to show how amazing this fact truly is. But what about the remaining 50%?

Actually, the remaining 50% of surveyed buyers came for one of three reasons: 20% came for retirement, another 20% came for our family-oriented atmosphere, and the remaining 10% came to enjoy our amazing local lifestyle.&nbsp;

**While this is great news, it’s still important for those moving to (or within) Salt Lake City to keep personal wants and needs in mind.** Our city is great as a whole, but we all lead different lives and our choice of home should reflect that.

There are three main factors buyers and sellers need to consider when the time comes to make a move within our city:&nbsp;

**1\. Location.** As you select your next property, it’s critical that you choose to live in an area that suits your lifestyle, your wants, and your needs.

**2\. Appreciation rates.** Certain areas in our city have higher appreciation rates than others. By focusing your search in areas that promise higher growth in value over time, you’re doing yourself (and our city) a favor.&nbsp;

**3\. Long-term happiness.** Buying a home is a major commitment. When you select a property, it should be one that you can see yourself feeling comfortable in for years to come. You don’t need to stay in the property for decades if that isn’t what you want, but you should keep your future lifestyle in mind before you reach the closing table.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like any additional guidance as you prepare to make a move, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
