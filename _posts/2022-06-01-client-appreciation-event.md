It’s that time of year again and I'm very excited to invite you to our **client appreciation movie event on June 11** at 9335 State St. in Sandy. We’ll be watching the new Jurassic Park. Picking up tickets and taking photos with family and characters will start at 1 p.m. The movie starts at 2:30 p.m.

Go to [justinudyevents.com](justinudyevents.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to register. We’re providing five tickets and a $10 concession voucher per family. If your family is larger, just call us directly and we'll make sure that you're taken care of.

My favorite thing about these events is that we get to say thanks for working with us. We're excited to see you and your families. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us. We’re looking forward to seeing you at the movies on Saturday, June 11.
