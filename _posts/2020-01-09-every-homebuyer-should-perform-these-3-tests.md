When you’re looking to purchase a property, there are three tests you should make sure to perform. These tests will help you evaluate whether it’s really worth buying. More importantly, they can save you from making a bad purchase that you’ll regret down the road.

Each home is unique, but you should always make sure to do these three things before making a purchase:

**1\. Have a home inspection.** Hire an accredited, professional home inspector to come and evaluate the home. They’ll provide you with a list of everything that’s wrong with the property. Not all of these issues will be important, but some can be deal-breaking problems.

**2\. Test for radon.** Recently, we’ve been finding the presence of radon in a lot of homes. This gas can be hazardous toward homeowners, so it’s important to make sure you don’t buy a property that’s filled with it. If radon is present, however, there are mitigation systems that can remove the gas and make your home safe.

**3\. Test for methamphetamine.** Utah has a high rate of addiction problems, and past residents may have used drugs in the property. Homes many need to be decontaminated after drugs like methamphetamine are used in it.

There are other checklists we provide our clients, but these three tests are also very important. If you have any questions or would like to learn more, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
