The age-old debate between renting and owning has long been a topic of discussion among business owners, landlords, and first-time homebuyers. Questions like "Should I rent or buy?" or "Should I lease or purchase?" are common dilemmas that many face when considering real estate options. Here are my thoughts on what you should consider when renting or buying.

A while ago, my teenage daughter and her friends were baking a cake. One of the girls, impatiently expecting the cake to be done in 10 minutes, increases the oven temperature, only to find the cake still uncooked after 15 minutes. Justin's lesson from this incident is profound: you can't rush certain processes, including real estate investments. Just as a cake needs time at the right temperature to bake properly, real estate investments require patience and strategic planning.

This is why buying real estate is so important. The acronym SALE determines the key points about the benefits of owning real estate:

**Stability:** Owning a property provides stability through fixed rates and payments, unlike renting, where costs can escalate over time. Real estate investments offer a reliable financial foundation amidst market fluctuations.

**Appreciation:** Despite short-term market fluctuations, real estate generally appreciates over time, presenting opportunities for growth and financial gain. Attempting to time the market is futile, and long-term ownership yields substantial benefits.

**Leverage:** Property ownership enables leveraging equity, creating opportunities for further investments and financial leverage. Over time, paying down a mortgage builds equity, which can be utilized for various investment endeavors.

**Equity:** The accumulation of equity in real estate assets translates to increased ownership and financial stability. Property owners can tap into this equity for home improvements, investments, or other financial needs, fostering wealth accumulation and long-term financial security.

It’s best advised to avoid  the short-term allure of renting, acknowledging its flexibility but emphasizing the financial stagnation it often entails. Individuals should seize opportunities for property ownership whenever feasible, as it paves the way for wealth creation and passive income in the long run.

By embracing these principles and investing in real estate wisely, individuals can build lasting wealth and financial security for the future. In the meantime, call or email me or my team. We’d love to hear from you!
