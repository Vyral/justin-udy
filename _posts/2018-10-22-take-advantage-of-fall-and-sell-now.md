There are five primary reasons why fall presents a great opportunity to sell your home quickly and for top dollar.

Here are the top five reasons the fall is actually a great time to sell your home.

First, **there’s less competition on the market.** During this time, a lot of other home sellers end up taking their homes off the market because their kids are busy with school, they have work obligations, or selling at the end of the year just doesn’t make sense for them.

Second, **buyers are more motivated to buy.** They want to get into a home before the holidays arrive or before the end of the year. It’s possible that some have been searching since the summer, and they’re ready to become homeowners now.

Third, **interest rates are still phenomenal.** Interest rates have adjusted, and sometimes when that happens, affordability becomes an issue. If you sell now, though, you can still lock a buyer into a low rate.

Fourth, **homes show beautifully during the fall.** 92% of all buyers start their home search online, and 64% will pay more for a home that looks move-in ready. This is why a lot of folks who plan on putting their home on the market in December or January are taking photos of it now.

Lastly, **it’s a lot easier to move now than when there’s snow on the ground.**

If you’d like to put your home on the market now or you have any questions about our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
