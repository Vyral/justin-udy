I’m so excited to invite you to our upcoming holiday event. Please join us at Wheeler Historic Farm (6351 South 900 East Murray, UT 84121) on Saturday, December 14, from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. Santa Claus himself will be there to take photos, and in addition, we’ll have a cookie decorating session, a coloring contest, fun prizes, and more. Come hungry, too, because Waffle Love will be catering. Head on over to our **[Eventbrite page](https://udyevents.eventbrite.com/){: target="_blank"}** to RSVP.

If you ever have any questions about real estate, please don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I would love to help you.
