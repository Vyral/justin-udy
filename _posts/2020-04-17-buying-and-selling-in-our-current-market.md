What is happening with buyers and sellers in our current real estate market? There have been many changes in our lives recently: the coronavirus, the economy, stay-at-home orders, the stock market, etc. The bad news is we have buyers that are afraid to view properties, and sellers taking their homes off the market. The great news is that real estate is acclimating day by day. We’re being much more conscientious about how we’re showing houses, and that may include doing it virtually.

If you have questions about this or any other real estate topic, give me a call. I’m here to help.<br>&nbsp;
