When I talk to people about buying land or investing in property, one question comes up a lot: *How can I make sure I’m making a smart investment without overpaying or running into hidden costs?* Whether you’re buying a home, investing in property, or planning a construction project, it’s easy to get overwhelmed.

The key is understanding the true potential and limitations of the land you’re looking at. Let me walk you through what I focus on to make sure my investments are safe and profitable.

**Property zoning.** The first thing I look at is the zoning. I ask myself: *Is this land residential, commercial, or multifamily?* Zoning determines what you’re allowed to do right away and what may require additional approvals.

* **Permitted uses**: You can start building immediately.
* **Conditional uses**: These require an approval process, which can affect your timeline and investment plan.

Knowing this upfront saves time, money, and headaches down the line.

**Property access.** Even if a property looks great from the road, you need to know if it’s truly accessible. Is it landlocked? Are there easements or restrictions? Understanding how you can access the property is critical, not just for construction but also for future use and resale.

**Topography.** I also evaluate the land’s topography. For example, if there’s a slope or rocky terrain, I consider whether retaining walls or other modifications are needed. These features can increase labor costs, construction time, and overall budget. Knowing the topography early helps me make realistic financial decisions for the project.

**Utility access.** One of the trickiest areas is utilities. I ask: *Does the property have water? Is there electricity? How about a sewer or a septic tank?* If utilities aren’t included, I estimate the cost to bring them in.

I’ve seen projects where hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent just to get utilities to the site, sometimes more than expected, because the ground was rocky or difficult to work with. Accounting for this upfront prevents surprises later.

**Market value.** I look at what comparable properties in the area are selling for. For example, if a lot costs $400,000 and building a home will cost $700,000, that’s $1.1 million total. If nearby homes are selling for $800,000 or $900,000, I need to ask myself: *Does it make sense to move forward here, or should I negotiate the lot price or look elsewhere?*

**Do your research and make smart decisions.** Buying land or investing in property can be rewarding, but only if you do your research. I always recommend evaluating zoning, access, topography, utilities, and market potential before committing. Using available resources, including city information and real estate professionals, can make a huge difference.

I’ve worked on many properties over the years, and I’ve seen firsthand how careful planning leads to successful projects. Whether it’s for your home, your business, or an investment, taking the time to understand every detail ensures you maximize value and minimize risk.
