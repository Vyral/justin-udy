If you’re one of the many folks wondering what’s going to happen in 2020, you’re more than welcome to have a copy of our 2020 Housing Forecast Executive Report; just text or email us and we’ll be happy to discuss the details with you.&nbsp;

This report covers a vast array of market metrics, but today I’m sharing the most interesting items from it that not only affect your home, but also your family, friends, and coworkers.&nbsp;

First, **expect job growth for 2020.** We had a record year in 2019—a 2.8% increase\! Though that will likely drop a bit throughout this year, it’s still forecast to be a cozy 2.3% increase.&nbsp;

Experts are anticipating 13,700 people migrating into our area, which is more than the number of people leaving. Our labor market was crazy this year, with unemployment at 2.2%. **We haven’t seen unemployment that low in 70 years\!** For 2020, that rate is projected to be around 3%.&nbsp;

2019 was also a record for new construction homes. 10,000 new homes were built, and in 2020 we’re likely to see a slight decrease to about 8,500 newly constructed homes. Interestingly enough, **of those 10,000 built in 2019, 75% were apartments.&nbsp;**

All the top economists are in loose consensus that interest rates should remain below 4% this year. Our median home price in 2019 for single-family homes was $380,000, and it’s expected to increase by 5%. We’re also anticipating that condo and townhome prices will increase by 10%.

If you’re looking to buy or sell a home this year or you simply want more in-depth information about how the market is trending, please feel free to reach out via phone or email. We love hearing from you and are always glad to help.
