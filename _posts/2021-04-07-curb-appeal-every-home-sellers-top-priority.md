When staging a home, many people unfortunately forget about one of the most important parts: curb appeal. Your home’s exterior is what makes buyers want to come inside and see the rest of what the property has to offer; in fact, buyers often make a decision within the first 15 seconds about whether the home is the right fit. Because of this, you want to be sure your home is enticing upon first glance. Here are a few ways to make sure your home’s curb appeal is as effective as possible:

**1\. Care for the lawn:** Make sure the grass is mowed, the plants are trimmed, and the lawn is beautifully manicured.

**2\. Power wash the exterior:** Spray all the dirt and grime off of your house, driveway, sidewalks, and front patio.&nbsp;

**3\. Focus on the front:** Consider getting a new front door or painting it, putting down a new welcome mat, or updating fixtures. You can also add new numbers, door knockers, lights, and other features that freshen up your home.

**4\. Trim the trees and bushes:** You want passersby and potential buyers to see your property.&nbsp;

**5\. Consider adding flowers:** Putting potted plants on the patio or adding flower gardens can make your home feel inviting—color makes a huge difference.

**6\. Hide garbage cans and toys:** You don’t want anything to distract from the clean, tidy image of your home.

**7\. Tidy up the beds:** Add new mulch or rocks, pull out any weeds, plant flowers, and find ways to make the beds look pristine and fresh.

**8\. Fix the gutters and hoses:** Make sure hoses are rolled up neatly or hidden away entirely, and be sure to repair any problems with the gutters.

I hope these tips have helped you figure out what you may need to focus on outside your home. By improving your curb appeal, you can get more people in the door and have a better chance of finding the perfect buyer.
