As agents, we know that real estate transactions can get pretty complicated. However, the truth is that complication kills momentum. If things get too complicated, oftentimes we abandon the project altogether. Today I’ll explain how complication kills momentum and how you can avoid it.&nbsp;

**When things get complicated, we tend to not move forward on them.** For example, look at the house I am filming this video in. Before, it had a classic 90’s-style look. By making a few small improvements such as painting the cabinets, updating the hardware, and replacing the light fixtures, we were able to make a huge difference in presentation.&nbsp;

During this process, we made sure we went through everything in a checkmark list. Once you start a process like improving a home, it’s easy to get carried away by all the possibilities. If you don’t check yourself, you might feel overwhelmed and end up leaving the house unfinished.&nbsp;

**My number one piece of advice to avoid complications is to consult with an expert.** They have the experience necessary to inform you of the best practices for whatever you’re doing.&nbsp;

**My second tip is to create a written plan.** This helps you avoid hypotheticals and stay focused on the task at hand. While the plan doesn’t have to be written in stone, writing out steps to take gives us a foundation to fall back on.&nbsp;

**My third tip is to hire a professional.** Sometimes we feel like we have to do all the work, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. If you hire an expert, the work will be simpler, better, and possibly insured. Insured experts are great because if anything doesn’t go according to plan, they can always come back and help.&nbsp;

**My final recommendation is to finish the project.** It seems obvious, but we’ve all been in a situation where one issue is holding up an entire project. If you find yourself experiencing this, try and find an expert who can get you across the finish line.&nbsp;

Hopefully, these tips help you keep things simple and moving forward. If you have any questions about today’s topic or anything else, do not hesitate to reach out to me. I am always willing to help.
