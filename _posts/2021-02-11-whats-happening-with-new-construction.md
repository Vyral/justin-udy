New construction has changed significantly over the last 12 to 24 months. There are a few things you should know whether you’re considering buying, upgrading, or just looking at the market.&nbsp;

The top 10 builders in the country make up 30% of all single-family home sales. Builders own tons of land, and they’re selling it. Lumber prices have also increased in the last year by up to 170%. **Lumber prices alone make a new home about $40,000 more expensive** than in the recent past.&nbsp;

80% of builders are experiencing delays either due to shortages, the pandemic, or both. So the cost of new construction is rising, and houses are taking longer to complete. Reminder: If the home is more expensive, you’ll likely have to make more or higher payments, so make plans for that. Also, **ensure your financing and interest rate are secured** because they often have a time frame for how long they apply.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about new construction or real estate in general, please reach out via phone or email. We’d be glad to help you.
