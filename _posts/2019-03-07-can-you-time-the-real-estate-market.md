In our Utah real estate market, conditions change all the time. Whether this is a result of the seasons, the beginning or end of the school year, or a number of other factors, there’s certainly something to be said for the impact these developments have on market conditions.&nbsp;

Both locally and nationwide, the second and third quarters tend to be the busiest times of year for our market, but why is that?

There are actually a number of reasons. It’s easier for families to buy and sell while their children are out of school, for one, and the nicer weather at these times of year is also an incentive for people to get out and begin hunting for the perfect home. **The market tends to be most active between April and September.**

However, though these months do bring a higher number of interested buyers, they also bring an increased amount of competing sellers. If you’re thinking of selling, you should get in touch with us as soon as possible, as it will generally take between two to six weeks to prepare a property for the market.

**Only after you’ve repaired, upgraded, and staged your property will you be ready to put it up for sale.** After this point, things will hopefully move quickly. Listings in an average price point will generally spend about 17 days on market, with homes at lower prices moving even more quickly and homes at higher price points moving slightly slower.&nbsp;

Of course, all of these points should be taken with a grain of salt. Your personal circumstances will likely vary, and this is why it’s important to reach out to us (your trusted real estate professionals). We would be happy to guide you not only on how to properly time your move, but also on every other aspect of the sale, as well.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
