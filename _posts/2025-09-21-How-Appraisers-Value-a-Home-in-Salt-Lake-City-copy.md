What better way to celebrate fall than by gathering with the people who’ve helped make our journey possible? For nearly a decade, our Annual Harvest Fest has been a cherished tradition, giving us the chance to say thank you and enjoy time together.

Join us for this year’s **Harvest Fest on Friday, November 8th, from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at Wheeler Farm.** We’ve planned plenty of fun activities for the whole family to enjoy:

• **Chick-fil-A** catering and a cozy **hot chocolate bar<br>**• **Face painting** and **balloon art** for the kids<br>• A **craft station** to decorate feathers for the community turkey<br>• **Family photos** with our on-site photographer<br>• A **raffle** for a chance to win a **Blackstone grill<br>**• And before you go, a **pumpkin pie** to take home

This event is our way of showing appreciation to everyone we’ve had the chance to work with, past, present, and future. Bring your family, enjoy great food and fun, and make lasting memories with us.

**RSVP today** so we can plan enough food and pies for everyone. If you haven’t received the flyer, we’ll send all the details once you RSVP. We can’t wait to see you there.

If you have any questions about the event or about real estate, reach out at [**(801) 285-0521**](tel:&#40;801&#41;%20285-0521) or [**Justin@JustinUdy.com**](mailto:Justin@JustinUdy.com). I’d be happy to help.
