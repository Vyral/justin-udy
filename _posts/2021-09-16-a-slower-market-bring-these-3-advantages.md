We had a red hot market with so many offers and buyers, and when we shifted to a more normal market, people felt that was a bad thing. In reality, it’s healthy. The market will ebb and flow — that’s normal economics. Any state of the market can bring problems, and we were seeing three problems earlier this year that the slower market fixes:

**1\. We saw a lot of buyers who weren’t serious,** which sometimes distracted from the more serious buyers. Now that the market is slower, fewer buyers are backing out of the process.&nbsp;

**2\. Buyers didn’t always have time to do their due diligence.** We’ve seen buyers of properties we were selling get into a bit of trouble because they didn’t have time to do this research. A slower market lets everyone take their time and make sure everything is in order.

**3\. It was hard to transition homes.** With the market that competitive, people were wondering how they could get a new house if they sold their old one. That’s why we had so many lease-backs or other creative solutions to this problem. With a slower market, this is not as big of an issue.

When there’s a change in the market, it isn’t negative, it just changes how we do business. If you have any questions about the state of the market or anything else real estate-related, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We’re always here to help.
