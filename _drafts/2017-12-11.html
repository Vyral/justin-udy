Actually, there are a couple of reasons.  Whether you’re buying an investment property, you’re buying a second property, or are moving into a single-family home, the terms of the market are just as valuable as the price.  Let’s take the example of comparing a $1 million home at a 1% interest rate to a $100,000 home with a 10% interest rate. These payments would end up being very similar, but the real issue is the terms of the interest rate.</span></span></div><br /><div class="quote-box"><span class="quote quote-left">“</span><br /><div class="quote-text">The terms of the market are just as valuable as the price.</div><br /><span class="quote quote-right">”</span></div><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">There are a few quick statistics I’d like you to think about. <b>The average rental rate in the market is constantly rising.</b> And with all of the people currently moving into our area, this is expected to continue.  My point is that: interest rates in the market allow us to purchase and own at a better price. This means you can typically own a home for less money than it would take to rent one.   These interest rates will not last. And when they do rise, <b>you won’t be able to match the kind of terms we’re seeing today.</b> If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</span></span></div></div>
